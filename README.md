 ***TUSHAR here, good day to all***.

***As an avid user of technology, I find new and forthcoming projects and technologies to be highly inspiring.
In addition to my academic abilities, I consider myself to be highly confident and have no trouble speaking in front of a group.
I was a Community Evangelist for Reskilll.***

***I have a great interest for hackathons and have participated in more than 45 of them in a variety of positions.
I speak in public and am active in the community.
In addition, my two favourite things are food and travel.***

***Please don't hesitate to contact me; I'd be happy to hear from you and assist you in any way I can.***
